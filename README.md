 Data for Fresh MARTA Markets project headed by Dr. Hilary King.


"GTFS-10222020_RawData" is the .zip file pulled from the MARTA website. 

"route.compiled.csv" contains all aggregated MARTA stop data and census tract data (see "data_compiled.ipynb" to see how this was done).

"MARTA_Data.ipynb" contains code used to filter for different subsets of this dataset.

"MARTA_Data" contains all outputs of the python file in .csv format ("to_csv" command in jupyter notebook).

These outputs were used to create the spreadsheet.
